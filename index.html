      <h1>The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</h1>

      <p>
        Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating
        systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s
        rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their
        own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the
        command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version
        control systems, and much more!
      </p>

      <p>
        Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of
        their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to
        make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering
        these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how
        to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems
        that would previously seem impossibly complex.
